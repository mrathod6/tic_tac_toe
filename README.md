Console Tic Tac Toe game written in python

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in python. I picked up this tutorial from techwithtim.net as I wanted to learn the logic of 
creating a game on a console. I learned quite a few things while building this application and had a lot of fun with it. I understood
how to seperate my functions in order to implement moves in the game. I also understood how to make a board game and how to also store
information which was new for me. 

I am hoping to be able to use this new information to create a sudoku solver next.
